# Clairity Device Agent (WIP)

This package will host the local companion service that bridges ophthalmic
devices with the Clairity web app, delivering the *Local Device Ingest Bridge*
epic.

Initial milestones:

- Prototype serial and watched-folder ingestion after packaging into a single
  executable.
- Establish authentication and message schema shared with the web workspace.
- Wire up the MVP polling uplink before iterating on the persistent channel.

The current contents are scaffolding only—expect rapid iteration as discovery
tasks complete.
