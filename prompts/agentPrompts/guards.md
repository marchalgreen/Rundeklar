🧱 Clairity Guardrails

These guardrails define the non-negotiable engineering constraints for the Clairity Desktop-Web codebase.
They ensure maintainability, data safety, and design consistency across all epics.

⸻

🧩 Architecture & File Structure
• Never move files across domains (components/, store/, lib/, etc.) without stating why in the epic plan.
• New UI components:
• Shared UI → src/components/
• Windows → src/components/windows/
• Never delete or rename files silently. All removals or renames must be called out in the plan or PR summary.
• Prefer composition over duplication. If multiple windows share logic, extract to /lib or a shared hook.

⸻

🎨 Styling & Design System
• Use Tailwind v4 tokens (see design-tokens.md and tailwind.config.ts).
• No hard-coded hex values. Use tokens or semantic Tailwind utilities.
• Use shadcn/ui primitives and lucide-react icons for all new UI.
• No new UI libraries or design systems unless explicitly justified and approved in the epic plan.
• Respect macOS/Tahoe visual identity — radius, shadows, glass, focus rings.
• Hairlines use rings, not borders:
• ✅ `ring-1 ring-[hsl(var(--line)/.12)]`
• ❌ `border-[hsl(var(--line))]`

📱 Responsive Design (CRITICAL)
• **ALL UI components MUST be responsive by default.** This is non-negotiable.
• **Mobile-first approach**: Always start with mobile styles, then enhance for larger screens.
• **Standard breakpoints**: Use Tailwind's `sm:` (640px), `md:` (768px), `lg:` (1024px), `xl:` (1280px).
• **Device targets**: Mobile (0-639px), Tablet (640-1023px), Desktop (1024px+).
• **Responsive spacing**: Use responsive padding/margins (`px-4 sm:px-6 md:px-8`).
• **Responsive typography**: Scale text sizes appropriately (`text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg`).
• **Responsive layouts**: Grids and flex layouts must adapt (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`).
• **Touch targets**: Buttons/links must be at least 44px on mobile (`px-3 py-2` minimum).
• **Testing requirement**: Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px before committing.
• **No fixed widths**: Never use fixed pixel widths without responsive alternatives.
• **No desktop-only layouts**: Always provide mobile/tablet alternatives.
• See RESPONSIVE_DESIGN_GUIDE.md for complete patterns and examples.
• ❌ `className="w-[620px] px-6"` (fixed width, no responsive)
• ✅ `className="w-full sm:max-w-[620px] px-4 sm:px-6"` (responsive)

🧾 Docs & Documentation System
• All docs pages must render inside the unified layout (`UnifiedDocLayout`) via a section-level `layout.tsx`.
• Sidebar navigation is driven by `src/components/docs/nav/index.ts` and presets — never hardcoded per page.
• Each docs change originates from a single **Epic** (`docs/epics/<Module>/EPIC-<module>.md`).
• When regenerating docs:
• Backup → `docs/_trash/<module>-<timestamp>/`
• Clear → `src/app/docs/<module>/**` (keep layout.tsx)
• Scaffold → Overview, Quickstart, UI Guide, API pages via Codex task.
• Swagger pages must always embed live specs:
• `/docs/<module>/api/swagger` → `/api/docs/swagger?spec=/api/docs/<module>.json`
• Specs live under `src/lib/docs/*OpenAPI.ts` and are served by `/api/docs/<module>.json`.
• No guessed endpoints or manual Swagger HTML.
• Sidebar links may never point to non-existent pages. Remove or add placeholders instead of leaving 404s.
• All docs use Tailwind tokens — rings, surfaces, and HSL vars. No hex or raw borders.
• All docs PRs must include validation:

1. `pnpm run validate`
2. Manual smoke on `/docs/<module>` routes (sidebar + pages)
3. Swagger embed renders successfully.

⸻

🗃️ Database / Prisma
• No schema or model edits unless explicitly defined in the plan.
Each DB-touching epic must include:
• Migration name
• Model diffs (old vs new)
• Data migration or backfill strategy
• Commands for local and production runs
• Commands must be included in the PR body:

pnpm prisma migrate dev --name <name>
pnpm prisma migrate deploy

• Never commit secrets, connection strings, or real URLs.
• .env keys must remain documented but values must be safe placeholders.

⸻

🧪 Build & Quality Gates
• All PRs must pass: 1. pnpm run validate → typecheck + lint 2. pnpm build → includes Prisma generate and Next build
• Maintain path-safe imports. No circular dependencies.
• Respect TypeScript strict mode.
• No any unless wrapped in a typed alias with a // TODO: refine note.
• Ensure new files pass Prettier and ESLint automatically.

⸻

📝 Code Comments & JSDoc (CRITICAL)
• **JSDoc is required** for all exported functions, classes, components, hooks, and services.
• Comment for intent, invariants, and non-obvious rationale — never restate what the code already says.
• Hooks must document inputs, returned shape, side effects, and error handling pattern.
• Services must document inputs/outputs, invariants, and edge cases; keep functions pure where possible.
• API functions must document request/response shapes and expected errors.
• Module-level README must be added/updated when introducing new modules or significant features.
• Keep comments concise and up to date; remove stale comments during refactors.

Example JSDoc:
```ts
/**
 * Creates a new player.
 * @param input - Player creation data
 * @returns Created player with generated ID
 * @throws {AppError} On validation or persistence failure
 */
export async function createPlayer(input: PlayerCreateInput): Promise<Player> { ... }
```

⸻

♿ Accessibility & Localization
• Maintain logical focus order and visible focus rings.
• All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable.
• Default copy language: Danish (da-DK).
• Keep labels short, clear, and clinical in tone.
• If adding new text, ensure it’s ready for localization (no hardcoded inline text in logic).

⸻

⚡ Performance
• Avoid blocking hydration with expensive sync logic.
• Lazy-load heavy components or data when possible.
• Limit Framer Motion use to short, low-impact transitions.
• Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
• Defer analytics or non-critical network requests until post-mount.

⸻

🪟 Windowing & Desktop Behavior
• Never break or bypass Window component behavior:
• Snap zones
• Minimize animations
• Titlebar buttons
• Window focus/blur states
• Do not mutate the global desktop Zustand shape without prior approval.
• Follow useDesktop() conventions for opening, focusing, and minimizing windows.
• Keep window chrome consistent across all windowed experiences.

⸻

🔒 Security & Data Integrity
• Never log secrets or personally identifiable information (PII).
• Always sanitize external or user-generated input using zod schemas.
• When handling IDs (e.g., scanned barcodes), validate format and sanitize before storage or lookup.
• Avoid leaking internal identifiers to client logs or external APIs.
• All fetches to vendor or network APIs must include error handling and safe fallbacks.

🛡️ Code Organization & Best Practices

**CRITICAL: Think architecturally. Always consider separation of concerns, modularization, and where code should live.**

• **Architectural Thinking First** — Before writing code, think about:
  - Where should this code live? (component, hook, service, utility, API layer?)
  - Is this logic reusable? (extract to hook/service/utility)
  - Does this belong in the current file or should it be extracted?
  - What is the separation of concerns? (UI, business logic, data access)
  - Should this be a new file or added to existing?

• **Error Handling Best Practices** — Use centralized error handling for consistency:
  - **User-facing errors**: Always use `normalizeError` from `src/lib/errors.ts`
  - **Error normalization**: Use `normalizeError(err)` instead of manual extraction
  - **Error display**: Use `normalizedError.message` for user messages via toast notifications
  - **Pattern**: Follow the pattern in `usePlayers`, `useSession`, `useCheckIns` hooks
  - **Local handling**: Only when you need component-specific error state that doesn't need user notification
  - ❌ `catch (err) { const msg = err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Error' }`
  - ✅ `catch (err) { const normalizedError = normalizeError(err); notify({ variant: 'danger', title: '...', description: normalizedError.message }) }`

• **Code Modularization** — Extract and organize code properly:
  - **Reusable logic** → Extract to hooks (`src/hooks/`)
  - **Pure business logic** → Extract to services (`src/services/` or `src/lib/`)
  - **Formatting/validation** → Use existing utilities (`src/lib/formatting.ts`, `src/lib/validation.ts`)
  - **Constants** → Use centralized constants (`src/constants/index.ts`)
  - **Complex components** → Break into sub-components (`src/components/[feature]/`)
  - **Data fetching** → Use existing hooks or create new ones following the pattern

• **Before Writing Code Checklist**:
  1. **Understand the problem first**: 
     - What is the actual problem? (not just symptoms)
     - What does the user want to achieve?
     - What are the constraints/requirements?
  2. **Propose solution before implementing**:
     - Explain what you think the problem is
     - Explain how you plan to solve it
     - Verify the solution will actually solve the problem (mental test)
  3. **Where should this code live?** (component, hook, service, utility, API?)
  4. **Does similar code already exist?** (check hooks, services, utilities)
  5. **Is this reusable?** (extract if yes)
  6. **What's the separation of concerns?** (UI vs logic vs data)
  7. **Should this be a new file?** (if it's a new concern/feature)
  8. **What pattern do similar features use?** (review existing code)

• **File Organization Principles**:
  - **Single Responsibility**: Each file should have one clear purpose
  - **Separation of Concerns**: UI components don't contain business logic
  - **Reusability**: Extract reusable logic to hooks/services/utilities
  - **Discoverability**: Code should be easy to find (follow existing structure)
  - **Maintainability**: Changes should be localized (modular structure)

• **When User Suggests Changes**:
  - **Think about architecture**: Where should this code live?
  - **Consider existing patterns**: How is similar functionality implemented?
  - **Propose structure**: Suggest file organization if needed
  - **Extract if needed**: Don't just add to existing file if it violates separation of concerns
  - **Ask if unclear**: If unsure about architecture, propose options

• **NO console.log/console.error in production code**:
  - ❌ `console.log('Debug:', data)` or `console.error('Error:', err)`
  - ✅ Use `normalizeError` and toast notifications for user-facing errors
  - ✅ Use proper logging infrastructure if needed (not console.*)

🧠 Principle

Clairity code is surgical, auditable, and reversible.
If a change can't be cleanly rolled back, it's too large for a single epic.
**Never create local solutions when centralized patterns exist.**
