# Verify Multi-Tenant Setup

## ✅ Current Status

Your database shows 2 clubs/users for `herlev-hjorten` tenant. Let's verify everything is set up correctly.

## Verification Queries

Run these queries to verify your setup:

### 1. Check user roles
```sql
SELECT id, email, role, tenant_id, email_verified, created_at
FROM clubs
WHERE tenant_id = 'herlev-hjorten'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Expected:** Should show your admin users with `role = 'admin'` or `role = 'sysadmin'` (or `role = 'super_admin'` for backward compatibility)

### 2. Verify migrations were applied
```sql
-- Check if all new columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'clubs' 
  AND column_name IN ('role', 'username', 'pin_hash', 'pin_reset_token', 'pin_reset_expires')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

**Expected:** Should show all 5 columns

### 3. Check constraints
```sql
-- Verify composite unique constraints exist
SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) as definition
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid = 'clubs'::regclass
  AND contype = 'u'
  AND conname IN ('clubs_email_tenant_unique', 'clubs_username_tenant_unique');
```

**Expected:** Should show both constraints

### 4. Check other tables have tenant_id
```sql
-- Verify all tables have tenant_id column
SELECT table_name, column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE column_name = 'tenant_id'
  AND table_name IN ('players', 'training_sessions', 'check_ins', 'matches', 'courts')
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected:** Should show tenant_id column in all tables

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Login

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/webapp
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Test Admin Login:**
   - Go to login page
   - Select "Administrator" tab
   - Log in with one of your admin emails
   - Should see admin menu in navigation

3. **Test PIN Login (if you have coaches):**
   - Go to login page
   - Select "Træner (PIN)" tab
   - Log in with username + PIN
   - Should access standard features

### 2. Create Coaches (Optional)

If you want to create coaches for testing:

1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to Admin → Coaches
3. Click "Opret træner"
4. Fill in email, username, and PIN
5. Save

### 3. Verify Tenant Detection

Test that subdomain detection works:

1. **Local development:**
   - App should detect tenant from URL or default to `herlev-hjorten`

2. **Production (after DNS setup):**
   - `herlev-hjorten.rundeklar.dk` → should load herlev-hjorten tenant
   - `demo.rundeklar.dk` → should load demo tenant
   - `rundeklar.dk` → should load marketing site (or herlev-hjorten)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't log in?

1. **Check user exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT email, role, email_verified FROM clubs WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

2. **Verify email_verified is true:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE clubs SET email_verified = true WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

3. **Check password hash exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT email, password_hash IS NOT NULL as has_password FROM clubs WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

### Admin menu not showing?

1. **Check role in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT email, role FROM clubs WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

2. **Should be 'admin' or 'sysadmin'** (or 'super_admin' for backward compatibility)

3. **Check JWT token includes role:**
   - Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Find `auth_access_token`
   - Decode at jwt.io
   - Should include `role` field

### Tenant detection not working?

1. **Check tenant config file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls packages/webapp/src/config/tenants/herlev-hjorten.json
   ```

2. **Verify subdomain in config:**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "herlev-hjorten",
     "subdomain": "herlev-hjorten",
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **Check getCurrentTenantId() logic:**
   - Should detect subdomain from hostname
   - Should fallback to 'herlev-hjorten' for localhost
