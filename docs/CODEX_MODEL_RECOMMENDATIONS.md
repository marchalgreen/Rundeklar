# Codex Model Selection Guide

## Quick Answer: Is `gpt-4o` Right for You?

**Yes, `gpt-4o` is a good default choice**, but here's when to consider alternatives:

- ✅ **Use `gpt-4o`** (default) - Best balance of speed, quality, and cost for most code tasks
- 💰 **Use `gpt-4o-mini`** - If you need cost efficiency and high volume
- 🎯 **Use `gpt-4-turbo`** - If you need maximum code quality and don't mind slightly slower responses
- ⚡ **Use `gpt-3.5-turbo`** - If you need fastest/cheapest and can accept lower quality

## Model Comparison

| Model | Speed | Code Quality | Cost | Best For |
|-------|-------|--------------|------|----------|
| `gpt-4o` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | **Default - best balance** |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High volume, cost-sensitive |
| `gpt-4-turbo` | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | Complex refactoring, critical code |
| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Simple tasks, rapid prototyping |

## Detailed Recommendations

### GPT-4o (Default) ✅ **Recommended**

**Use when:**
- You want the best balance of speed and quality
- Working on typical code generation/refactoring tasks
- Need good performance without breaking the bank
- Multimodal capabilities might be useful (though not needed for code)

**Pros:**
- Fast responses
- Excellent code quality
- Good cost/performance ratio
- Latest model with best general capabilities

**Cons:**
- More expensive than gpt-4o-mini or gpt-3.5-turbo
- May be overkill for simple tasks

**Cost:** ~$2.50-$10 per 1M tokens (input/output)

---

### GPT-4o-mini 💰 **Cost-Effective Alternative**

**Use when:**
- You have high-volume usage
- Cost is a primary concern
- You still need good code quality
- Working on straightforward code tasks

**Pros:**
- Much cheaper than gpt-4o (~10x cheaper)
- Still very capable for code generation
- Fast responses
- Good quality for most tasks

**Cons:**
- Slightly less capable than gpt-4o for complex tasks
- May struggle with very complex refactoring

**Cost:** ~$0.15-$0.60 per 1M tokens (input/output)

---

### GPT-4 Turbo 🎯 **Maximum Quality**

**Use when:**
- You need the absolute best code quality
- Working on critical production code
- Complex refactoring tasks
- Don't mind slightly slower responses

**Pros:**
- Excellent code quality
- Very thorough responses
- Great for complex tasks

**Cons:**
- Slower than gpt-4o
- More expensive
- May be overkill for simple tasks

**Cost:** ~$10-$30 per 1M tokens (input/output)

---

### GPT-3.5 Turbo ⚡ **Fast & Cheap**

**Use when:**
- You need maximum speed
- Cost is critical
- Working on simple code tasks
- Rapid prototyping/iteration

**Pros:**
- Fastest responses
- Cheapest option
- Good enough for simple tasks

**Cons:**
- Lower quality for complex code
- May produce less accurate code
- Not ideal for production-critical code

**Cost:** ~$0.50-$1.50 per 1M tokens (input/output)

## How to Change the Model

### In Codex Environment Setup

When creating the environment, set:

```
CODEX_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

(or whichever model you prefer)

### In Your Code

The model is automatically used from the environment variable. You can also override per-request:

```typescript
import { codexRequest } from '@/lib/codex'

// Use default from env
const response1 = await codexRequest({ prompt: '...' })

// Override for this request
const response2 = await codexRequest({ 
  prompt: '...',
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini' // Use cheaper model for this call
})
```

## Cost Estimation

For typical code generation tasks:

- **Small task** (~500 tokens): 
  - gpt-4o: ~$0.001-0.005
  - gpt-4o-mini: ~$0.0001-0.0003
  - gpt-3.5-turbo: ~$0.0003-0.0008

- **Medium task** (~2000 tokens):
  - gpt-4o: ~$0.005-0.02
  - gpt-4o-mini: ~$0.0005-0.001
  - gpt-3.5-turbo: ~$0.001-0.003

- **Large task** (~8000 tokens):
  - gpt-4o: ~$0.02-0.08
  - gpt-4o-mini: ~$0.002-0.005
  - gpt-3.5-turbo: ~$0.004-0.012

## Recommendation Summary

**For most users:** Start with `gpt-4o` (the default). It's the best balance.

**If cost matters:** Switch to `gpt-4o-mini` - you'll save ~90% with minimal quality loss.

**If quality is critical:** Use `gpt-4-turbo` for maximum code quality.

**If speed/cost is everything:** Use `gpt-3.5-turbo` for rapid iteration.

## Testing Different Models

You can easily test different models by changing the `CODEX_MODEL` environment variable:

```bash
# In .env.local
CODEX_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Try the cheaper option
# or
CODEX_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo  # Try maximum quality
```

Then test the same prompts and compare results!
